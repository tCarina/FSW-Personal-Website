aP.innerText = "Hello! My name is Carina and I am a fullstack web engineer born and raised in Far Rockaway, Queens. During my lifetime I have always loved working in team environments and with people of all different walks of life. One of the things I love the most bout the tech industry is that I have been able to meet and work with people frum such diverse backgrounds. Not only that, but I have always had a love for all things tech since I was young, thanks to my father. Since an early age, I've always been interested in taking things apart and learning to mod hardware. With tech I get to combine all my interests as well as hopefully use all that I know to help marginalized and underrepresented communities such as the BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities. Besides tech, I like to consider myself creative. I make resin art, make vinyl decals, and love to experiment with makeup. I also dabble a bit in videogames, anime, and am an avid fan of anything relating to horror. Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to know more about me, I look forward to hearing from you. "
